<img src="lovegina.PNG" width="278" height="203" align="right"/>
<p> Bathing is the most important ways to maintain good health and protecting our self from infection, illness, and ailment. Maintaining cleanses is also important for our self-confidence, physical and emotional well-being. The purpose of washing is to remove dirty odor.</p>
<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<P>To youngsters, teenagers and those who care for them, there are 3 things to remember:
•	The first thing to accept is that you will probably never look like those perfect specimens in the media - but you can, and WILL look good to most people if you follow basic personal hygiene principles 
•	Secondly, your actions and the way you behave are more important to most people than the way you look
•	Thirdly, good hygiene practices will help to keep you healthy, give you confidence and be pleasant for those around you
</p>
<h2>Social Reasons</h2>
<p>Most people hate to be talked about, especially in a negative manner. By ensuring that our body is clean and well presented, we are more assured of projecting a positive body image that reflects our personalities. 
healthy Children should be taught the importance of hygiene and how to achieve good hygiene very early to keep themselves and others and to reduce the risk of being bullied at school. 
</p>
<h2>Health Reasons</h2>
<p>Poor hygiene can lead to poor health. If you have cut yourself, the wound should be cleaned and dressed suitably, this can help reduced the risk of infection and pain. 
Conditions such as head lice, athlete’s foot etc. should be treated immediately to prevent further  and spread to others. 
Hand washing cannot be emphasized enough as this simple action can prevent a plethora of illnesses and disorders developing. Many people ‘forget’ to wash their hands after using the toilet or before handling foods; this can cause a great deal of illness and even death. 
</p>
<h2>Psychological Issues</h2>
<p>By being well presented, clean and tidy, people can feel more confident, especially in social situations. Our chances of succeeding either in work or social settings, or even with the opposite sex can be altered by maintenance of good hygiene. 
Maintaining hygiene practices helps to reduce the risks of ill health, but equally important affects how we and others perceive ourselves and can influence our levels of confidence and self-esteem which can affect many aspects of our lives.
